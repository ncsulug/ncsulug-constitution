## Amendment Procedures

If you have a proposed constitutional amendment:

1.  Fork this repository.
2.  Create a new branch for your amendment and commit your changes.
3.  Open a Pull Request.
4.  Present it at a meeting.
5.  We'll vote on it at least two weeks later.
6.  After ratification, a LUG officer will merge it into master.

While GitHub pull requests are preferred (because hey, we're the LUG),
amendments can be submitted in any format, so long as the constitutionally
defined procedures are followed.
